# CNN-ML-PBF
This repository contains a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) designed to predict temperature fields in multi-laser powder bed fusion (ML-PBF) simulations. The model is trained on FEM-simulated data and leverages supervised learning to infer melt pool behavior based on key process parameters.
